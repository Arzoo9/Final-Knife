It gives option for selecting ingredients from subtypes of ingredients, which exclude boring typing ingredients and remove chances for spelling mistakes. Each item it allows option to add note for its quantity and prep direction along the item. It also allows to add only helping text for recipes. We can add photo of recipe too. 

Special requirements:
It reqired active internet connection. Just need to create new account to get started with.

Orientation:
UI will only suport for Portrait mode 
Device:

Third-party Libraries: 
We have used Firebase in our program. All dependencies can be found in pod-init file.

Not working:
We haven't implemented load wait graphics (Buffering, proccessing image). So, Everything works with good internet connection, if internet doesn't work, need to wait for while before it shows notification.
